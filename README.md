## chitter_chat ##
A basic console based chat client / server

### About ###
I am using this project to enhance my understanding of python

### Proposed Application ###
chitter_chat will offer a basic server/client interaction that will allow users to create and join groups. Others may then
join these groups by name to allow basic instant chat interaction between all members of the group. Users will create accounts
where they will specify a password for authentication. The user should be able to log in with the same credentials they used
regardless of if the server is restarted (persistent accounts).

Functionality may be added later after these components have been implemented.
